/*
 * THE BTREE:
 *
 * At a high level, bcache's btree is relatively standard b+ tree. All keys and
 * pointers are in the leaves; interior nodes only have pointers to the child
 * nodes.
 *
 * In the interior nodes, a struct bkey always points to a child btree node, and
 * the key is the highest key in the child node - except that the highest key in
 * an interior node is always MAX_KEY. The size field refers to the size on disk
 * of the child node - this would allow us to have variable sized btree nodes
 * (handy for keeping the depth of the btree 1 by expanding just the root).
 *
 * Btree nodes are themselves log structured, but this is hidden fairly
 * thoroughly. Btree nodes on disk will in practice have extents that overlap
 * (because they were written at different times), but in memory we never have
 * overlapping extents - when we read in a btree node from disk, the first thing
 * we do is resort all the sets of keys with a mergesort, and in the same pass
 * we check for overlapping extents and adjust them appropriately.
 *
 * struct btree_op is a central interface to the btree code. It's used for
 * specifying read vs. write locking, and the embedded closure is used for
 * waiting on IO or reserve memory.
 *
 * BTREE CACHE:
 *
 * Btree nodes are cached in memory; traversing the btree might require reading
 * in btree nodes which is handled mostly transparently.
 *
 * bch_btree_node_get() looks up a btree node in the cache and reads it in from
 * disk if necessary. This function is almost never called directly though - the
 * btree() macro is used to get a btree node, call some function on it, and
 * unlock the node after the function returns.
 *
 * The root is special cased - it's taken out of the cache's lru (thus pinning
 * it in memory), so we can find the root of the btree by just dereferencing a
 * pointer instead of looking it up in the cache. This makes locking a bit
 * tricky, since the root pointer is protected by the lock in the btree node it
 * points to - the btree_root() macro handles this.
 *
 * In various places we must be able to allocate memory for multiple btree nodes
 * in order to make forward progress. To do this we use the btree cache itself
 * as a reserve; if __get_free_pages() fails, we'll find a node in the btree
 * cache we can reuse. We can't allow more than one thread to be doing this at a
 * time, so there's a lock, implemented by a pointer to the btree_op closure -
 * this allows the btree_root() macro to implicitly release this lock.
 *
 * BTREE IO:
 *
 * Btree nodes never have to be explicitly read in; bch_btree_node_get() handles
 * this.
 *
 * For writing, we have two btree_write structs embeddded in struct btree - one
 * write in flight, and one being set up, and we toggle between them.
 *
 * Writing is done with a single function -  bch_btree_write() really serves two
 * different purposes and should be broken up into two different functions. When
 * passing now = false, it merely indicates that the node is now dirty - calling
 * it ensures that the dirty keys will be written at some point in the future.
 *
 * When passing now = true, bch_btree_write() causes a write to happen
 * "immediately" (if there was already a write in flight, it'll cause the write
 * to happen as soon as the previous write completes). It returns immediately
 * though - but it takes a refcount on the closure in struct btree_op you passed
 * to it, so a closure_sync() later can be used to wait for the write to
 * complete.
 *
 * This is handy because btree_split() and garbage collection can issue writes
 * in parallel, reducing the amount of time they have to hold write locks.
 *
 * LOCKING:
 *
 * When traversing the btree, we may need write locks starting at some level -
 * inserting a key into the btree will typically only require a write lock on
 * the leaf node.
 *
 * This is specified with the lock field in struct btree_op; lock = 0 means we
 * take write locks at level <= 0, i.e. only leaf nodes. bch_btree_node_get()
 * checks this field and returns the node with the appropriate lock held.
 *
 * If, after traversing the btree, the insertion code discovers it has to split
 * then it must restart from the root and take new locks - to do this it changes
 * the lock field and returns -EINTR, which causes the btree_root() macro to
 * loop.
 *
 * Handling cache misses require a different mechanism for upgrading to a write
 * lock. We do cache lookups with only a read lock held, but if we get a cache
 * miss and we wish to insert this data into the cache, we have to insert a
 * placeholder key to detect races - otherwise, we could race with a write and
 * overwrite the data that was just written to the cache with stale data from
 * the backing device.
 *
 * For this we use a sequence number that write locks and unlocks increment - to
 * insert the check key it unlocks the btree node and then takes a write lock,
 * and fails if the sequence number doesn't match.
